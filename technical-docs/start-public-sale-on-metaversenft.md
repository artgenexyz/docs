# Start public sale on MetaverseNFT

On your MetaverseNFT main contract, there is a sale control. You can change public mint price, start/stop sale.

To start sale, either call `startSale` or `updateStartTimestamp` with a timestamp to start sale. Use [https://www.unixtimestamp.com/](https://www.unixtimestamp.com) to get a timestamp.
