## How to use IPFS Desktop

## Hiya!

Uploading gigantic folders and files to IPFS sometimes could be tricky! But we are going to make it. I tried to write complete instructions on how to do this. But feel free to ask if something isn't going according to plan. ðŸ˜‰

### IPFS Desktop

1. First thing we need to do is to install [IPFS Desktop client](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/#install-instructions). Follow the link and choose your option.
2. Open your IPFS Desktop and wait a bit until it loads.

### Configurations

1. By default IPFS protects you from memory clogging. But it also prevents us from uploading large files! On sidebar on the left go to `SETTINGS` tab.

1. Scroll down to `IPFS CONFIG` section

1. Set `"GCPeriod"` to `"10h"` (it should be `"1h"` by default)

1. Set `"StorageGCWatermark"` to 99. And set `"StorageMax"` to your content size + 15GB (e.g. if your folder size is 50GB set `"StorageMax"` to `"65GB"`)

1. Yep! Restart your IPFS app. Just close and open it again ðŸ˜„

That was the hardest part! Let's start uploading ðŸ˜œ

### Uploading

1. Send your CID to us!

This is it! Now it's time for us to retrieve your content from your node! It's like a torrenting. So please don't close your IPFS Desktop app until we upload all your files (we'll pin it to the IPFS network - so when you disconnect, the files will still be available). We'll let you know when it's over. ðŸ˜Š
