# 🐶 Create an NFT drop without code

You can use Buildship app to create a large NFT drop with your own contract:\
[https://app.buildship.xyz](https://app.buildship.xyz)\
\
You can freely use it on Ethereum testnet, but you can't deploy to mainnet unless you have an **Early Access Pass NFT**\
\
You need to [apply for early access](../apply-to-closed-alpha.md) to get your **Early Access Pass NFT**
