If you're raising less than **100 ETH (currently \~100,000$),** you can launch straight away. If you want to raise more, you need to [apply for early access](../apply-to-closed-alpha.md) to get your **Early Access NFT.**

### Pricing

Buildship charges **5% of minting funds** (no secondary royalties). If you're doing a free mint or raising less than **2 ETH**, you'll be charged **0.1 ETH** one-time deployment fee.
