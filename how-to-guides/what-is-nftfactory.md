# üè≠ What is NFTFactory?

**MetaverseNFTFactory** is an amazing tool by [buildship.xyz](https://buildship.xyz) that allows you to deploy your NFT contract to Ethereum 10x cheaper.

### True ownership with your own contract

You need your own contract for your NFT collection if you want:

* independence of centralized NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible
* decentralized art storage like IPFS
* minting on your own website
* custom primary & secondary sales splits
* custom features: presale lists, mint passes, on-chain art, staking, vesting, etc.
* unique ASCII artist signature

Usually, your own contract requires coding or hiring your own developers, and costs \~**0.5 ETH** to deploy. Also, it might contain security issues that will lead to unrecoverable loss of funds or blocking bugs.&#x20;

That's why we built our MetaverseNFT contract that already helped creators raise more than **1500ETH (\~4.8M$)** without any security issues.

### Super-cheap deployment gas fees

Factory cuts down contract deployment cost to **0.02-0.04 ETH** (**\~60-100$**) instead of and lets you launch large NFT collections (e.g. PFP drops) with minting on your own website.

### 40% lower minting gas fees

We've been able to reduce minting gas fees by using **ERC721** instead of **ERC721Enumerable** standard

`Disclaimer for pros: most of the users don't need Enumerable specific methods. But for those who need methods like`` `**`walletOfOwner()`**`, you can use free Moralis API for fetching the same data`

### Feature-rich with extensions

Even more, Factory architecture allows everyone to build & connect Extensions with additional functionality: batch mint, presale, mint pass, on-chain art, dutch auction, delayed claim etc.\
